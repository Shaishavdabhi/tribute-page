<font size="4">Buffett started selling Juicy Fruit chewing gum packs. When asked for 1 piece, he would not sell as he thought he may be left with 4 pieces he could not sell. He made 2 cents profit per pack.<br><br>
Buffett would also purchase Coca-Cola six packs for 25 cents from his grandfather’s grocery store – Buffett and Son. He would sell each Coke for 5 cents. Profit of 5 cents per pack.</h4><br><br></font>
<h5 class="text"><b><font size="5"><em> 1941 – Age 11:</b></font></em><br><br>
 <font size="4"> At 11 years old, Buffett buys his first stock – 6 shares of Cities Service (now known as CITGO – an Oil company) at $38 per share. He bought 3 for himself and 3 for his sister Doris.<br><br>
  That is all the money he had at that time. Practiced little to no diversification at a young age which he continued to do throughout his investment career. The stock price fell to $27 but soon went to $40. He sold the stock at $40, but, the stock shot up to $202 in the next few years.<br><br></h5>
  He later cited this experience as an early lesson in patience in investing. </font><br><br>
